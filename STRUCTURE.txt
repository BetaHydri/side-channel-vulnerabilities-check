================================================================================
CURRENT VERSION: v2.3.0 (Breaking Change Release)
================================================================================

USAGE:
  Run from root: .\SideChannel_Check_v2.ps1 [-Mode <mode>] [-ShowDetails] [-WhatIf]
  Legacy v1 available in: archive\v1\

BREAKING CHANGES IN v2.3.0:
  ⚠️  Mode names changed for clarity (Interactive = user makes choices):
      • RevertInteractive → Revert (quick undo last backup)
      • Restore → RestoreInteractive (browse all backups, select, restore)
  
  Migration: Update any scripts/automation calling these modes.

KEY IMPROVEMENTS IN v2.3.0:
  ✓ Fixed backup/restore switch statement cases
  ✓ Fixed L1TF runtime detection (shows "Inactive" not "Supported")
  ✓ Color coding logic considers Category + ActionNeeded (not just status)
  ✓ "Not Configured" status now returns "Vulnerable" (not "Unknown")
  ✓ Platform-aware fair scoring (skips non-applicable mitigations)
  ✓ Comprehensive documentation with color coding explanations
  ✓ Screenshot added to README.md showing correct color implementation
  ✓ Platform Applicability Matrix showing all 20 mitigations by platform
  ✓ ESXi/vSphere administrator guidance with PowerCLI examples

FEATURES (v2.3.0):
  • 5 dedicated modes (Assess, ApplyInteractive, Revert, Backup, RestoreInteractive)
  • Platform detection (Physical, HyperVHost, HyperVGuest, VMwareGuest)
  • 20 side-channel mitigations (19 for VMs, all 20 for Hyper-V hosts)
  • Color-coded output based on criticality:
    - Green = Protected/Active
    - Red = Critical vulnerabilities (ActionNeeded = "Yes - Critical")
    - Yellow = Optional/Consider (Category = "Optional" OR ActionNeeded = "Consider")
    - Gray = Informational/Not Applicable
  • Hardware detection (UEFI, Secure Boot, TPM 2.0, VT-x, IOMMU, VBS/HVCI capable)
  • Intelligent security scoring with visual progress bar (platform-aware)
  • Runtime status detection via SpeculationControl module (when available)
  • Selective apply & restore ([R]ecommended/[A]ll, [A]ll/[S]elect)
  • WhatIf support for all modification modes
  • PowerShell 5.1 & 7.x compatible (runtime Unicode generation)
  • Comprehensive educational detailed view (-ShowDetails)
  • Educational output with CVE numbers, descriptions, URLs

PLATFORM SUPPORT:
  ✅ Windows 10/11 (Physical)
  ✅ Windows Server 2016/2019/2022 (Physical & Hyper-V Host)
  ✅ Windows VMs on Hyper-V (Guest)
  ✅ Windows VMs on VMware ESXi/vSphere (Guest)
  ❌ ESXi/vSphere hosts (Linux-based - see HYPERVISOR_CONFIGURATION.md)

DIRECTORY STRUCTURE NOTES:
  - No archive/ directory - all v1 code has been removed
  - Backups/ contains actual backup JSON files (not ignored by git in this repo)
  - Logs/ and Config/ are empty (created at runtime as needed)
  - docs/ contains documentation assets (screenshots, diagrams)
  - .git/ contains repository metadata

TESTING:
  Run test suite: .\Test-SideChannelTool.ps1
  Tests parameter validation, mode selection, backup/restore logic

DOCUMENTATION FILES:
  - README.md: Full feature documentation, color coding guide, platform matrix
  - QUICKSTART.md: Quick reference for common tasks
  - HYPERVISOR_CONFIGURATION.md: ESXi/vSphere/Hyper-V host guidance
  - LICENSE: MIT License terms

VERSION HISTORY:
  v2.3.0 (2024-12-02): Breaking change - mode renaming + UX improvements
  v2.2.0: Platform detection, fair scoring, runtime status
  v2.1.0: Hardware detection, selective operations
  v2.0.0: Complete rewrite with dedicated modes
  v1.x:   Legacy version (archived)
